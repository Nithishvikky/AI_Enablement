PYTHON CODING STANDARDS GUIDE
Version: 1.0
Audience: Backend / Platform / Automation Engineers

==================================================

SECTION 1: GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Code must prioritize readability over cleverness.

A developer unfamiliar with the codebase should understand logic within 5 minutes.

Follow PEP8 unless explicitly overridden by project rules.

Avoid premature optimization.

One function = one responsibility.

Explicit logic is preferred over implicit behavior.

If behavior is non-obvious, document WHY, not WHAT.

SECTION 2: FILE AND PROJECT STRUCTURE

Standard project layout:

project_root/
app/
init.py
main.py
config.py
services/
models/
utils/
tests/
requirements.txt
README.txt

Rules:

No business logic in main.py

No circular imports

Group files by domain, not by technical type

Tests must mirror app structure

SECTION 3: NAMING CONVENTIONS

Variables:

Use snake_case

Names must be descriptive

Avoid generic names like data, temp, value

Examples:
user_count
retry_limit
request_timeout_sec

Constants:

Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Examples:
MAX_RETRIES
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SEC

Functions:

snake_case

Verb-based names

Examples:
fetch_user()
calculate_total_price()
validate_schema()

Classes:

PascalCase

Nouns only

Examples:
OrderProcessor
UserRepository

SECTION 4: TYPE HINTS (MANDATORY)

All production Python code must use type hints.

Rules:

Use built-in generics (list, dict, tuple)

Avoid Any unless unavoidable

Return types must always be specified

Examples:

def get_user(user_id: int) -> dict | None:
pass

def process_orders(orders: list[dict]) -> list[int]:
pass

SECTION 5: DOCSTRINGS

Docstrings are mandatory for:

Public functions

Classes

Complex private functions

Use Google-style docstrings.

Example:

def calculate_discount(price: float, discount: float) -> float:
"""
Calculates discounted price.

Args:
    price (float): Original price
    discount (float): Discount percentage

Returns:
    float: Final price after discount
"""


SECTION 6: ERROR HANDLING

Rules:

Never use bare except

Never silently ignore exceptions

Always log errors before raising

BAD:
try:
x = int(value)
except:
pass

GOOD:
try:
x = int(value)
except ValueError as err:
logger.error("Invalid integer input", exc_info=err)
raise

Custom exceptions should inherit from Exception.

SECTION 7: LOGGING

Rules:

Use logging module only

Do not use print in production code

Log levels must be appropriate

Levels:

DEBUG: Development-only details

INFO: Normal operations

WARNING: Recoverable issues

ERROR: Failures

CRITICAL: System unusable

Example:

import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(name)

logger.info("Service started")
logger.error("Database connection failed", exc_info=True)

SECTION 8: SECURITY RULES

Never hardcode secrets.

Always use environment variables for credentials.

Validate all user input.

Avoid logging sensitive data.

Rotate secrets regularly.

BAD:
API_KEY = "sk-live-xyz"

GOOD:
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")

SECTION 9: PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES

Avoid nested loops on large datasets.

Prefer generators over lists when possible.

Batch database operations.

Avoid unnecessary object creation.

Use caching for expensive operations.

SECTION 10: TESTING STANDARDS

Rules:

Unit tests are mandatory.

Minimum coverage: 80%.

External services must be mocked.

Tests must be deterministic.

Example:

def test_addition():
assert add(2, 3) == 5

SECTION 11: ASYNC PROGRAMMING RULES

Use async only when I/O bound.

Do not mix sync and async logic randomly.

Avoid blocking calls inside async functions.

Document async usage clearly.

SECTION 12: CODE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS

Pull requests must:

Follow coding standards

Include tests

Include meaningful commit messages

Avoid unrelated changes

If code needs explanation in review comments, it likely needs refactoring.

SECTION 13: COMMON ANTI-PATTERNS

God functions

Hardcoded configuration

Global mutable state

Copy-paste logic

Silent exception handling

SECTION 14: INSTRUCTION PRIORITY

When conflicts occur, follow this order:

Security rules

Coding standards

Type safety

Performance

Convenience

If requirements are unclear, request clarification instead of guessing.
