I apologize, but I don't actually have access to any specific billing or refund policies. As an AI assistant, I don't have information about particular companies or services. For the most accurate answer regarding your eligibility for a refund, I recommend contacting the customer support team of the service you subscribed to directly. They will be able to review your account details and explain their refund policy for your situation. Many companies do offer refunds within a certain timeframe after renewal, especially if the service wasn't used, but policies vary. The customer support team is best equipped to assist you with this specific billing issue.

**Question:** `I downgraded my plan mid-cycle. Why am I still seeing Pro features and a higher charge?`

**Response:**
```text
I understand your concern about seeing Pro features and a higher charge after downgrading your plan mid-cycle. Here's an explanation of what's likely happening:

1. Billing cycles: Most subscription services bill for the full cycle upfront. When you downgrade mid-cycle, the changes often take effect at the start of the next billing cycle.

2. Pro features access: You're probably still seeing Pro features because you've already paid for them for the current cycle. The service typically allows you to keep using what you've paid for until the cycle ends.

3. Higher charge: The charge you're seeing is likely for the previous billing cycle when you were still on the Pro plan. Your next bill should reflect the lower price of your downgraded plan.

4. Prorated refunds: Some companies offer prorated refunds for unused time on higher plans, but this isn't universal. Check the company's policy on this.

5. Next steps: Your downgraded plan and lower pricing should take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. If this doesn't happen, I'd recommend contacting the company's customer support directly.

If you need more specific information, it would be helpful to know which service you're using, as policies can vary between companies. Don't hesitate to reach out to their customer support for clarification on your particular situation.

**Question:** `I downgraded my plan mid-cycle. Why am I still seeing Pro features and a higher charge?`

**Response:**
```text
Thank you for reaching out about your plan downgrade and billing concern. I understand you're seeing Pro features and a higher charge despite downgrading mid-cycle. Let me clarify this for you.

When you downgrade your plan mid-cycle, the changes typically take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. This means:

1. You'll continue to have access to Pro features until the end of your current billing period.
2. The higher charge you're seeing is likely for the current cycle, which was billed in advance for the Pro plan.

Your next bill will reflect the new, lower-priced plan. The downgrade will be fully implemented at the start of your next billing cycle, at which point you'll lose access to Pro features and be charged the new, lower rate.

To confirm the exact date when your downgrade will take effect, could you please provide your current plan type and billing date? With this information, I can give you a more precise timeline.

Is there anything else I can help clarify regarding your plan change or billing?

**Response:**
```text
I understand your concern about being charged for an annual plan you forgot to cancel. Let's walk through this scenario step-by-step based on our billing policies:

1. Identifying the issue:
This is a case of an unintended renewal of an annual subscription.

2. Applying the relevant billing policy:
Our policy states that annual subscriptions are refundable for unused months minus a 10% processing fee.

3. Determining eligibility:
Since you mention that you haven't used the service at all since the renewal, you are eligible for a refund. However, it won't be a full refund due to our processing fee policy.

4. Reasoning:
- You have an annual subscription that was recently charged.
- You haven't used the service since the renewal.
- Our policy allows refunds for unused months on annual plans.
- A 10% processing fee applies to all refunds on annual plans.

5. Final resolution:
You are eligible for a refund of 90% of the annual subscription cost. The 10% processing fee will be retained.

To proceed with the refund:
1. We'll initiate the refund process for 90% of your annual subscription cost.
2. The refunded amount should reflect in your account within 5-7 business days after processing.

**Question:** `I downgraded my plan mid-cycle. Why am I still seeing Pro features and a higher charge?`

**Response:**
```text
I understand your concern about seeing Pro features and a higher charge after downgrading your plan mid-cycle. Let me explain how this works and what you can expect:

1. Identifying the issue: This is a billing query related to plan downgrades and their effect on charges and features.

2. Applying the relevant policy: For monthly subscriptions, we bill in advance and they are non-refundable. This policy affects how downgrades are processed.

3. Determining the outcome: Based on our billing policy, here's what typically happens in this scenario:

   a) When you downgrade mid-cycle, the change is usually scheduled to take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.
   b) Until the next cycle begins, you retain access to the features of your current (higher) plan.
   c) The charge you're seeing likely reflects the higher-tier plan you had at the beginning of the current billing cycle.

4. Reasoning:
   - We bill in advance for the full month.
   - Mid-cycle changes don't result in partial refunds due to our non-refundable policy.
   - To ensure you get the full value of what you've paid for, we maintain your current level of access until the next cycle.

5. Final explanation:
   You're still seeing Pro features and a higher charge because your downgrade will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. Until then, you have full access to the plan you initially paid for this month. Your next bill will reflect the lower price of your new plan.

Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify about this billing process?
